= Learning Python

== Lesson 1: String

The file `UdemyLecturesAndPractices.py` in branch `explain` is an explanation of the solutions done by @ahmedibrahim365 in the master branch file `UdemyLectures&Practices.py`. As you may have noticed, the file is named to remove the somewhat problematic `&` in the file name and made to follow the Unix/Linux file endings.

OH! We also added this readme to make it easy to remember what we've done. Please see the source code file `UdemyLecturesAndPractices.py` for for the **why**.

#this is the readme.adoc
#it can also be readme.me

== I can add my own section

Here to the new section!!
